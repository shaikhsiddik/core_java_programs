Wrapper Classes:
Classes are used to represent primitive values as object are called wrapper classes.
There are 8 wrapper classes one per each primitive type to represent them as object.
6 wrapper classes represent number type values these wrapper classes are called number wrapper classes.

***Autoboxing:
                Primitive type to the object of their Corresponding wrapper classes is known as autoboxing
***Unboxing:
                Reverse process of autoboxing. Automatically converting an object of a wrapper classes to its corresponding
                primitive type is known as unboxing.
